**A List of 20 Children’s Books by African Authors
A significant part of the development of children is their reading. Each child has a vivid imagination, so fueling this can help them develop ideas that in effect help how they see the world. Additionally, it helps them to develop empathy and understanding about the world from a young age.

Although it is necessary for everybody to read literature from around the world, if you are of African descent, it is a good idea to give your child an understanding of the various cultures in the continent early in their life.
