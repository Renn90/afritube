**MUSIC IN NIGERIA

The Nigerian music industry has undergone an incredible evolution, from its origins playing traditional genres to becoming a dominant force in global pop culture. 

The story began in the early 20th century with the development of highlife music. This blended Western instruments like guitars and brass with West African rhythms and percussion. Legendary origins like Bobby Benson pioneered this early fusion sound. In the 1960s and 70s, the iconic Fela Kuti came to prominence, using his afrobeat style protest music to boldly criticize Nigeria's corrupt military governments. 

By the 1980s, juju music spearheaded by King Sunny Ade became hugely popular by combining Yoruba rhythms with western pop melodies. At the same time, Nigerian reggae and rock bands also emerged. The 90s saw the rise of artists like 2Face Idibia who achieved great success with R&B and pop blended sounds. 

But it was in the 2000s and 2010s that Nigerian music truly went global. Stars like D'Banj, P-Square, Wizkid, Davido, and Tiwa Savage masterfully fused myriad African styles with hip-hop, R&B, dancehall, and more to create the burgeoning Afrobeats genre. Music releases went from tapes to CDs to streaming. Nigerian artists began collaborating with major Western stars, getting Grammy recognition, and touring the world. 

From Highlife's early days to afrobeats' current supremacy, Nigerian music has tremendously transformed over the past century. Combining infinite creativity with pride in their roots, Nigerian artists have taken their cultures to the pinnacle of modern pop music. The future looks even brighter as the scene expands its creativity and reach.
