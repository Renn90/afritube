**OIL BOOM: 

The oil boom in Nigeria occurred in the early 1970s after oil was discovered in the Niger Delta region in the late 1950s. Some key facts about Nigeria's oil boom period:

 Oil Exports Start: Nigeria began exporting oil in 1958 shortly after the first oil fields were discovered. However, it was the OPEC oil embargo of 1973 that truly triggered a boom.

 Peak Production: Oil production and exports increased rapidly through the 1960s and 1970s, peaking at over 2 million barrels per day in 1979.

 Economic Windfall: Oil exports led to a massive influx of revenue into Nigeria, providing up to 90% of government income by the mid1970s. The GDP grew significantly.

 Infrastructure Spending: The government embarked on huge public works projects including highways, airports, housing complexes, and universities. However, corruption was also widespread.

 Per Capita Income Grows: With the new oil wealth, per capita income increased from $100 in 1960 to over $1,000 by the late 1970s as the economy prospered.

 Agricultural Decline: Focus shifted away from agriculture leading to a decline in this traditional economic sector. Nigeria went from a food exporter to an importer.

 Increasing Inequality: Most of the oil wealth enriched only a small minority, widening inequality between classes and regions, and contributing to future unrest. 

 Boom Ends: By the early 1980s, falling oil prices led to declining revenue and an economic crisis, ending the boom period. But oil has remained vital for Nigeria.
