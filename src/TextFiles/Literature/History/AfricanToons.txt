**A List of Black African Made Children's Animated Cartoons

As usual in our EVCL studio we were having a passionate debate about African animation for children. Why isn’t there much of it? When will we have African children’s cartoon brands and companies that are just as big as Cartoon Network etc? Are parents & children ready for something like that? The usual questions we usually argue over whilst producing Bino & Fino.

Then an interesting question popped up. What qualified as Black African Animation for children? Now we have already put together a list of children’s animations that are African themed and also feature African characters as in human beings and not talking animals. The distinction about the talking animals is a very important one. Because even though talking animals are cute, when it comes to available children’s animation that is located in Africa the balance of media seems to overwhelmingly feature talking animals. It’s almost as if there are no humans living in our continent or something! We need more African children’s cartoons featuring Africans as opposed to animals case closed. I can go further in to why that is important in another post but I’m sure if you are reading this you why it is important.
Back to the question as to what constitutes African animation for children. We decided to narrow things down a bit further. You know we love doing lists so here are the criteria for a list we came up with.
Has to be at least 70% - 80% made in an African country using local. The challenges producing animation in countries such as Nigeria , Kenya, Ghana, Rwanda, South Africa are different to those faced when producing animation in the US, UK or Europe . It is also important because producing the animations locally where possible means a local industry is growing providing income and jobs. It is not always possible to achieve this but it is important.
It has to feature African human characters. This I understand is could be a contentious issue but bear with us on this one. For the purposes of this list, this requirement is important for reasons mentioned earlier.
